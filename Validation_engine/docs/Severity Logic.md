Severity Logic

Severity is not subjective.

It is derived from three axes:

Causal Impact

Does this violation break cause → effect reasoning?

Financial Exposure

How much real value is misrepresented?

Propagation Risk

Will this error contaminate downstream metrics?

Severity is therefore classified implicitly, not manually.

Structural violations affect correctness.
Causal violations affect truth.
Financial violations affect decisions.

Any violation that affects truth or decisions is considered critical, regardless of row count.
