Causality Model

This system assumes that data is not a record of events, but a trace of cause → state → effect.

Orders do not emerge from days.
They emerge from memory.

Marketing activity accumulates, decays, and spills forward in time.
Therefore, same-day validation is structurally invalid.

This engine enforces three non-negotiable causal laws:

No Effect Without Prior State
A paid-attributed order cannot exist unless historical marketing state exists for that channel.

Time Is Directional
Future activity cannot explain past outcomes.
Any attribution that violates temporal order is invalid by definition.

State Is Conserved, Not Reset
Zero spend today does not imply zero influence today.
Influence decays — it does not disappear.

If any of these laws are violated, analytical outputs are considered non-causal and untrustworthy.

This repository exists to detect those violations.
