Financial Drift Taxonomy

Financial mismatch is not a single error class.

This system classifies drift into distinct physical failure modes:

1. Rounding Noise

Magnitude: negligible

Cause: numeric precision

Action: ignore

2. Unallocated Waste

Platform spend exists

No acquisition cost assigned

Meaning: marketing burned cash without producing demand

Action: accept as loss, not as attribution error

3. Phantom Cost

Acquisition cost exists

No corresponding platform spend

Meaning: cost injected without economic source

Action: critical failure — investigate immediately

4. Allocation Logic Error

Spend and cost both exist

Distribution violates conservation

Meaning: attribution algorithm is broken

Action: revoke downstream metrics

All drift is economic evidence.
Only some drift is acceptable.
